    <string name="about_covid_19_info">
        Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus which may cause illness in animals or humans.
        In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common
        cold to more severe diseases. First identified in a cluster with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China.

    <string name="about_covid_19_Spreading3">
    People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19
    who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter
    (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

    <string name="about_covid_19_vaccination_what"><b>The Immune System: the Body\‚Äôs Defense Against Infection</b></string>
    <string name="about_covid_19_vaccination_what_subs">To understand how COVID-19 vaccinations act, it is necessary to first understand how our bodies handle illness. When germs enter our bodies, such as the virus that causes COVID-19,
        they fight and multiply. This invasion, known as an infection, is what causes sickness. To combat infection, our immune system employs a number of strategies.
        Blood comprises both red cells, which transport oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immunological cells, which fight illness. Different types of white blood cells fight illness in different ways:

   \n\n\u2022 <b>Macrophages </b>are white blood cells that eat and digest germs as well as dead or dying cells. The macrophages leave behind pieces of the invading germs known as "antigens."
        Antigens are recognised as harmful by the body, prompting antibodies to destroy them.
   \n\n\u2022  <b>B-lymphocytes </b>are white blood cells that serve as a defence. They produce antibody the virus pieces left behind by the macrophages.
   \n\n\u2022  <b>T-lymphocytes </b>are a different type of defensive white blood cell. They infect previously affected cells in the body.

\n\nThe When a person is first infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, it might take many days or weeks for their body to produce and use all of the germ-fighting tools required to overcome the infection.
        After the infection, the person\'s immune system recalls what it learnt about how to protect the body against such a disease.

\n\nTThe body stores a few T-lymphocytes known as "memory cells," which activate quickly if the body experiences the same virus again. When B-lymphocytes identify familiar antigens, they create antibodies to destroy them. Experts are still trying to figure out how long these memory cells can protect a person against the virus that causes COVID-19.

    </string>
    <string name="about_covid_19_vaccination_how"><b>How COVID-19 Vaccines Work</b></string>
    <string name="about_covid_19_vaccination_how_subs">Vaccines perform in a variety of ways to provide protection. However, with all vaccines, the body is left with a supply of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù T- and B-lymphocytes that will recall how to fight that virus in the future.
       \n\nT-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes are normally produced a few weeks after vaccination.\nAs a result, it is possible that a person\ncould become infected with the virus\nthat causes COVID-19 just before or\njust after vaccination and then become ill as a result of the vaccine failing to give adequate protection.
        \n\nSymptoms such as fever can occur after vaccination due to the process of generating immunity. These symptoms are natural and indicate that the body is generating immunity.
